##Introduction

This is the CodeBook for the Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment from Week 4.

##Raw Data

The raw data for this project came from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It was
collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
The data can be downloaded here

The full description of the experiments can be read here

##Description
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age
bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING,
WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded
accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial
angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been videorecorded
to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly
partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating
the training data and 30% the test data.
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying
noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50%
overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has
gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth lowpass
filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to
have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency
was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating
variables from the time and frequency domain.

##Data Files

The raw dataset included the following files:
‘README.txt’
‘features_info.txt’: Shows information about the variables used on the feature
vector.
‘features.txt’: List of all features.
‘activity_labels.txt’: Links the class labels with their activity name.
‘train/X_train.txt’: Training set.
‘train/y_train.txt’: Training labels.
‘test/X_test.txt’: Test set.
‘test/y_test.txt’: Test labels.
The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are
equivalent.
‘train/subject_train.txt’: Each row identifies the subject who performed the
activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
‘train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt’: The acceleration signal from the
smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units ‘g’. Every row shows
a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the
‘total_acc_x_train.txt’ and ‘total_acc_z_train.txt’ files for the Y and Z axis.
‘train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt’: The body acceleration signal
obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.
‘train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt’: The angular velocity vector
measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are
radians/second.

##Tidy Data

The Final dataset for this project consists of 1 File - “tidydata.csv”.

##Description

Each row represents 1 Subject and 1 Activity. The raw data included multiple
measurement observations for each Subject and Activity, so these were averaged
together for the final tidy dataset.

##Identifiers

2 columns in the dataset serve as Identifiers:
SubjectID - The ID for the subject participating in the experiment
Ranges from 1 to 30

###Activity - The type of activity performed by the subject for which the
measurements were taken
WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
STANDING
LAYING

##Measurements

The remaining columns are measurements taken by the smartphone for each Subject
and Activity

##Transformation

To get from the Raw Data to the Tidy Data the following transformations were made.
These transformations can be executed with the script ‘run_analysis.R’.
1. Merged the training and test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each
measurement.
3. Used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labeled the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, created a second, independent tidy data set with
the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
